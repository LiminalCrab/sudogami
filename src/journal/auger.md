Auger is an RSS feed aggregator built with Python and Postgres for the Merveilles webring project. It's hosted on https://www.auger.sudogami.com/. It was inspired by a seperate projected called Lieu, a search engine designed by Cblgh for community webrings. The goal of the project is to encourage members of the Merveilles webring to post on their sites. Auger is still in development, it's in a working state but there is plenty to do.
