Starlamp is a portfolio concious image gallery application using Django and Postgresql as its backend. The goal of the application is to be able to easily manage the content of your portfolio.

Actively being deveoped with two testing branches.

the Vue 3 and Express branch.

the Vue 3 and Django branch.

I've chosen to test both of these to see which one has a better workflow. I think Express will be the best initially, but depending on how far I can get with the Django branch I think it might have some surprising outcomes.
