You're in a forest, walking down a dilapidated asphalt road. To each side, the ruins of large concrete obelisks emerge from dense green growth
and rise to somewhere beyond the leafy ceiling. As you make your way through the desolation
you are greeted by the remains of a large metallic auspice, rusted red paint with pealing white
Cyrillic text, "All hail Communism! The brightest future we have!". You check the dosimeter, 1.2 mSv per hour.
