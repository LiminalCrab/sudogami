It's illegal to enter buildings in the zone as most 
of them are completely unstable, and due to a new 
zone administration there's typically no bribing 
your way out of a situation. Sometimes in the most
unsuspecting places you may find street art left 
behind by a Stalker who risked arrest for 
something many will never see. 
Somewhat of a real life Easter egg, 
or a subtle nod to defiance: 

"You're not suppose to be here."
