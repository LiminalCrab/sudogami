            <p><span> I'm considering this my "initial commit" of the journal. I have a ton to do on this site,
                including making it mobile and accessibiltiy friendly. </span></p>
            <p><span> I'm currently working on establishing the code base for sidg64, and getting a footing in C. Afterwards
                I plan to circle back around to Auger and flush some stuff out. Regarding Auger, I eventually plan to convert the back-end to C once
                I get a better understanding of it, on top of that I really need to figure out the one to many relations in Postgres so I'm not embeding so much
                redundant data into the DB itself. </span></p>
