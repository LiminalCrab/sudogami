				<h2>About</h1>
					<p><span>Welcome,</span></p>

					<p><span>This page is currently under construction so please bare with me while I flush out any rough edges, especially on mobile.
					I am Preston, I'm a programmer mostly on the web development side of things, but I also take a keen interest in network engineering 
					and plan to develop an assortment of tools on that front in the not so distant future.</span></p>

					<p><span>This website serves not only as my home, but as my library. Here you will find the projects I'm working on, as well as my 
					[<a href="journal.html">journal</a>] which contains logs and thoughts on those projects, it will also include stories from my travels, and topics I'm interested in.
					You will also find my [<a href="wiki.html">wiki</a>] which is an organized page of information that I have learned regarding pretty much anything I feel like adding.</span></p>

					<p><span>Please note that this website does not use JavaScript and is not a reflection of my abilities to use front-end frameworks. I've opted to
					use non-resource intensive code and good ol' fashion HTML and CSS for this site, well except for the wiki engine written in C but that aside,
					it's a completely static page. If you are looking for my work, I recommend taking a look at my [<a href="https://github.com/LiminalCrab">Github</a>].</p></span>
