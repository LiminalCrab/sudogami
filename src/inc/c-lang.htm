             <h3>START c language [2021/05/23 0055]</h3>
             <p><span> So it's time to get started understanding this beast. I spoke to Cancel on Merveilles and he was kind enough to provide me a resource to focus on.
                 Just the [<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C specifications</a>], I asked about using Stackoverflow and just the documentation to which he had informed me that Stackoverflow as a resource for C 
                 is like playing a game of telephone. I think that's true for most languages, and I'd honestly prefer learn from the source and make my own interpretations and seek help regarding them. Looking into it this document actually references another
                 document called The C Reference written by Dennis Ritchie, so I'll be using that as well. Both of these together should be good enough for basic syntax. I have a book called "The Elements of Computing Systems" that should do a good job at introducing low-level concepts to me.

                 If I feel truly lost, I'll go back to watching Harvard's CompSci 101 course. But for now, I'll take a crack at it the good old fashion way.
