            <p><span> Infoforcefeed [<a href="http://infoforcefeed.org/">website</a>] is a small and tight nit community of developers located on the Freenode IRC Network. 
            Though the community has an international presence, the majority of the members hail from Portland, Oregon. Unlike [<a href="merveilles.html">Merveilles</a>],
            Infoforcefeed has no barrier to entry, but it's abstract sense of humor functions as somewhat of a "culture check" for curious newcomers. 
            Members tend to work on whatever they please, and argue over whether or not Preston should build a parser in Javascript.</span></p>
