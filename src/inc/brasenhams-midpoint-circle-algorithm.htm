		<span><p>Brasenham's Midpoint Circle Algorithm is used to determine the points needed for rasterizing a circle in computer graphics. The algorithm draws all eight octants simultaneously, starting from each cardinal direction (north, east, south, west respectively).</p></span>
		<span><p> For a whole 360 degree object, divide it into 8 parts, each octant 45 degrees. After these octant pixels are established, one at each cardinal direction, the algorithm calculates the next pixel location from the previous known ones, and then draws a circle for a given radius and center. </p></span>
