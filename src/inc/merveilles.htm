			<p><span>"Merveilles is a community project aimed at the establishment of new ways of speaking, 
				seeing and organizing information. â€” A culture that seeks augmentation through the arts of engineering & design.</span></p>

            <p><span>We're trying to build a community that welcomes multidisciplinarity, with somewhat high standards of 
				discourse, focusing on the topics of experimental art, music & code. We ask of our members to consider the 
				impact of their works on the environment, and to optimize toward living more sustainably."</span></p>
