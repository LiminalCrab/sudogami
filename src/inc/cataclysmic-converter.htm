            <p><span> This was a joke I'd made after my car's check engine light came on. I used it as an excuse to learn C's syntax and get use to pointers. 
                It leaks memory and doesn't corrupt any file with an extension so it doesn't actually work correctly, but I got what I needed from it. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/LiminalCrab/cataclysmic-converter">here.</a>
