                Starlamp has it's initial setup with VueJS and is ready to go. This will be a full-fledge and resource intensive web application
                built with portfolios in mind. This won't be deployed on this site, rather I'm building it for friends in separate industries who need it for their work.
            </span></p>
            <p><span> CONTINUE starlamp [2021/06/27]
                Bit of a hiatus on this one, will come back soon though. Less interested in JS right now, feels like I'm not getting enough out of it.
