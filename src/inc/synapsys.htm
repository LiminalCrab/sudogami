         <h3>START synapsys [2021/06/27 0735]</h3>
        <span><p> Synapsys is how I'll synchronize time across multiple devices using a GPS time signal. Easier said then done, but I'll begin prototyping with NTP for the time being. 
            The GPS shit is going to take some money, I'll need another Raspberry PI and a receiver. I'm chosing GPS because of NTP congestion, I need time in nanoseconds magnitudes lower then what
            NTP can provide across the internet, where NTP typically provides around 1 milisecond of time accuraracy, GPS can provide around 14 nanoseconds under certain conditions. Just pray the sky is clear and everything will be okay. Smile.
