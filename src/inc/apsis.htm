         <h3>START apsis [2021/06/27 0729]</h3>
        <span><p>This project is going to be a behemoth of low level network programming with C, but one I'm very excited to begin. Apsis is a global metronome, the goal
         of Apsis is to keep artists conducting live performances over livestreams (network music performances) synchronized using a global pulse signal and a very
         precise time synchornization server I'm calling "Synapsys" or "Apsis Syncrhonized Systems" because I'm cool. Apsis itself will have a user interface built with SDL,
         where Synapsys will be your standard server CLI. It will require a Leader/Follower layout, where we have a leader metronome which will likely be tied to the individual with the lowest latencey
        and the Followers starting from the second lowest latency down. My reason for this is due to how the artists will have to hear one another. Speaking of hearing each other,
    for audio I/O I'll be using OpenAL. So, in general this project will be a combination of network programming, UI programming, and audio programming. All written in C. How exciting.</span></p>
