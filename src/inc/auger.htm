            <p><span>Auger is an RSS feed aggregator built with Python and Postgres for the Merveilles Webring Project. It's hosted on https://www.auger.sudogami.com/. 
            Inspired by Lieu, Auger was created to not only allow easier access to member sites in the webring, but to encourage members to post more on their sites. 
			Auger is still in development and there are plans to transition the backend to the C programming language.</span></p>
