## About
Welcome,
My name is Preston, I'm a programmer attending University for my bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. 

I'm working on [Starlamp](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/starlamp_base), an art portfolio gallery that utilizes the Django framework's url scheme and the power of python easily deploy image galleries without the need for a database. I think this is actually pretty funny considering one Django's strengths is it's ORM. I lead development on [Auger](https://auger.sudogami.com/page/0.html), an RSS feed aggregator for a community of artists and programmers. It was built with pure python and the Jinja2 templating engine and vanilla CSS. I've recently finished [Sidg64](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/sidg64), a tool with the purpose of producing 64 bit Unique IDs for small web applications, and I am prototyping the UI of a metronome called [Apsis](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/Apsis) though development on that is currently frozen while I focus on various obligations to others. 

I do much of my development in Python, I currently use Django for a variety of projects due to its excellent ORM and the Django REST Framework for building API endpoints. I use this alongside other tools such as Postgresql for database and whatever frontend framework I feel like using at the time. I have also built web applications in pure python with the assistance of standard libraries and the psycopg2 SQL lib.

My workflow includes containerization, I use Docker to help make development and deployments of my applications easier for myself and those that I am working with.

If you have any questions feel free to shoot me an email.
