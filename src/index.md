## About
Welcome,

This page is currently in development so please bear with me while I flush out any rough ages, especially on mobile. My name is Preston, I'm a programmer with a focus on web development. I'm currently working on [Starlamp](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/starlamp), an art portfolio content management system. I lead development on [Auger](https://auger.sudogami.com/page/0.html), an RSS feed aggregator for a community of artists and programmers. I also have an interest in Software Development, I've recently finished [Sidg64](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/sidg64), a tool with the purpose of producing 64 bit Unique IDs for small web applications, and I am prototyping the UI of a metronome called [Apsis](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/Apsis). 

This website is not a reflection of  my abilities to use front-end frameworks. I take a minimalist approach and try not to use resource intensive code when it comes to my own projects. If you're looking for my work, I recommend taking a loot at my [Github](https://github.com/LiminalCrab).
