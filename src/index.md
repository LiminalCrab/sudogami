## About
Welcome,
My name is Preston, I'm a programmer attending University for my bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. 

I'm working on [Starlamp](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/starlamp_base), an art portfolio gallery that utilizes the Django. I lead development on [Auger](https://auger.sudogami.com/page/0.html), an RSS feed aggregator for a community of artists and programmers. It was built with pure python and the Jinja2 templating engine and vanilla CSS. I've recently finished [Sidg64](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/sidg64), a tool with the purpose of producing 64 bit Unique IDs for small web applications, and I am prototyping the UI of a metronome called [Apsis](https://github.com/LiminalCrab/Apsis) though development on that is currently frozen while I focus on various obligations.
