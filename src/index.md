## About
Welcome,

This page is currently in development so please bear with me while I flush out any rough ages, especially on mobile. My name is Preston, I'm a programming enthusiast with experience in low-level software development and full-stack web development, but I also take a keen interest in network engineering and plan to develop an assortment of tools on that front in the not so distant future. This website not only serves as my portfolio, but as a sort of library where I actively plan, document, and scratchpad projects I'm working on, write wiki entries on interesting topics or things that I've learned, and detail my travels and experiences abroad.

This website is not a reflection of  my abilities to use front-end frameworks. I take a minimalist approach and try not to use resource intensive code when it comes to my own projects. If you're looking for my work, I recommend taking a loot at my [Github](https://github.com/LiminalCrab).
