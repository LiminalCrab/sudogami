title: thai beef curry
---

## Ingredients:

- 1/2 lb beef cubes
- 1 onion
- 1 can (13.5oz) coconut milk
- ~2 Tbsp thai red curry paste
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp corn starch [added after edit]

## Optional for max flavor:
- 1‚Äù piece ginger root
- 1-2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp Siracha

## Directions:

Chop the onion how you like (I like skinny longish pieces) and place in the bottom of the crockpot.Then put the beef cubes on top.

Throw the garlic, ginger, Siracha, sugar, curry paste, corn starch & coconut milk in your food processor and give a few good pulses. Pour the mixture into the crockpot, coating everything. If you have some basil leaves, tear them and sprinkle on top. Cook 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low. Serve over rice. Enjoy! (Serves 2, maybe 3)
