title: Honey Garlic Chicken
---

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs
- 3 garlic cloves minced or chopped
- 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 1/2 cup ketchup
- 1/2 cup honey
- optional fresh basil, shredded, for garnish


## Instructions

Place the chicken in the bottom of a 4-quart slow cooker. In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, soy sauce, ketchup and honey. Pour over the chicken and cover.

Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or high for 3 to 4 hours. Be sure to check the chicken periodically. My chicken was done after 5 hours on low. 

Remove chicken, place on a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Transfer the remaining sauce to a saucepan and reduce down over medium heat until desired consistency is reached. I mixed a teaspoon of cornstarch with a tablespoon of water and added it to the sauce and continued to stir and cook on medium heat until it thickened up a bit.

Serve a little sauce over the chicken and garnish with fresh basil.
Serve chicken over rice with some broccoli or green beans on the side.
