# About
This repository is a fork of [Hundred Rabbits](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co). It takes their C based wiki engine and adds Jinja2 to help templating and consistency across articles.

To use, 

run create_init.py in the root directory,
edit your content in the src/inc folder, 
run ./build.sh afterwards and you're good to go.
